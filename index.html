  <p>
    My whole has been spent moving around from one place to another. For some people, that my spark an urge to settle down in one place. But, at least up until now, the lack of a single place to call home has kept me in adventure. At thirty-four I have spent thirteen years working abroad. I have gone from being a teacher, to doing IT for a large educational program, and am now turning my sights towards programming.
